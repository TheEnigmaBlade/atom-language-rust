# Rust language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) files in [Atom](http://atom.io/).

Forked from the existing [language-rust](https://github.com/zargony/atom-language-rust) due to lack of support.

## Install

Install the package `language-rust` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager from a shell:

```bash
$ apm install language-rust
```

## Bugs

Grammar rules were written from scratch. They seem to work for most cases. However there are most certainly still a few cases that result in wrong syntax highlighting. Feel free to fix it and send a pull request, or open an issue to report it.
